Final project proposal
    In this final project I need to implement a program to manage project for student and faculty member, which I need
to manage relationship of each role in faculty. Each role have different action to take. From this situation I decide to
create each role as a class. Each class contain information of each user like their name and ID that will use in further
method. In each class will have method of each role's action that able to call for perform an action. In each action 
will effect some table in some way. After user properly login, my program will create new object of it own role's class.
In every role class will have common method which is menu to let user to choose their action to perform in each session.
After finish every session program will all exit function to record every change in this session and write into csv
file.
